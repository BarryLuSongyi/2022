TSP datasets

Ant Colony Optimization(ACO)-TSP.py
An ACO for TSP.Using a ant-cycle model with elite ants.

Genetic Algorithm(GA)-TSP.py
A GA for TSP.Using OX crossover and partial reverse mutation a high mutation rate and elite selection.

Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)-TSP.py
A PSO for TSP.Using OX crossover for generating a new sprout.

Simulated Annealing(SA)-TSP.py
A SA for TSP.Using OX crossover for generating a new sprout.

Imperialist Competitive Algorithm(ICA)-TSP.py
An ICA for TSP. Didn't perform well. Just for my personal interest.

Variable Neighbor Search(VNS)-TSP.py
A VNS for TSP. Using four method to generate neighborhood and same method to do local search. 
Random operator is not very good at this problem. Two-swap operator perform best in local search.

Adapative Large Neighbor Search(ALNS)-TSP.py
A ALNS for TSP. Using a SA technique to avoid local best. Not perform very well since a high temperature makes it not converge.
